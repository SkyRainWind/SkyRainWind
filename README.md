I am SkyRainWind, an undergraduate now majoring in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology.

I used to be involved in Competitive Programming Contest as a contestant and awarded gold medals in both ICPC and CCPC.

Currently I am interested in reinforcement learning and multi-modal embodied AI.
